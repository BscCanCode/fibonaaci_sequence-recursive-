# Fibonacci Sequence Script (Beginner Edition) - April 2025

## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A script to calculate Fibonacci numbers using recursion, built in April 2025. It allows multiple attempts with a 0-25 range and user continuation.

## Why I Built This
- To learn recursive Fibonacci calculation.
- To practice loops and user input.
- To experiment with sequence generation.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Computes Fibonacci numbers (e.g., fib(5) = 5) recursively.
- Accepts 0-25 input, warns about >25 (slow performance).
- Loops until user quits with "yes/no".

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Recursive function design for sequences.
- Using `while` for repeated input.
- Handling input limits and errors.

---

## ðŸ”„ Updates
- âœ… Implemented recursive Fibonacci.
- âœ… Added 0-25 range with >25 warning.
- ðŸš§ TODO: Optimize with iteration or memoization.
---

## Known Issues
- Inefficient recursionâ€”>25 is very slow.

## Development Notes
- Uses pure Python.

## NOTE
- README with AI chatbot help.
- Raw to show progressâ€”plan to refine.
